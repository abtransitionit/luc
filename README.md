## Why LUC

- A single binary (download or build from source)
- Manage resources for both **local OS** and **remote VMs**  
- Native support for **Rhel**, **Debian**, and derived distributions. 
- Unified linux management of:
  - Packages and package repositorires  
  - services 
  - kernel parameters and modules
- Zero dependencies, remote-ready architecture
- Go-Native Project Structure: Luc adheres to **standard Go project layout conventions** for maintainability and clarity:  
    | Directory | Purpose | Visibility |  
    |-|-|-|
    | `/pkg`       | Reusable Go libraries designed for external consumption (e.g., utilities, SDKs). | Public API â€“ Importable by other GO projects. |  
    | `/internal`  | Private application logic and implementation details. | Private API - Restricted to Luc's codebase. |  


```sh
# Create a production-grade Kubernetes cluster (KBE) on a set of VMs  
luc kbe init --runall  

# Deploy a Kind cluster (eg. for controller testing)
luc kind init --runall  

# Install any open-source tools on any linux container or VM distro
luc os provision kubectl, helm, nerdctl, runc, ...

# Install any open-source container runtime on any linux container or VM distro
luc os provision containerd, crio 

# Install any OS packages/repo on any linux container or VM distro
luc os dnfapt repo    ...
luc os dnfapt package ...  

# And more ...
```

# Core Features

## Go-Powered Efficiency

Built with industry-standard libraries:  

| Library | Role | Key Benefit |  
|-|-|-|
| **[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)** | CLI Framework | Simplifies evolution and maintenance with production-grade command structures |  
| **[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)** | Configuration | Unified config management across JSON/YAML/env vars |  
| **[Zap](https://go.uber.org/zap)** | Logging | High-performance structured logging with minimal overhead |  

## Extensible Architecture
Luc's extensible architecture is built on core design principles.

|Principle|Implementation|Benefit|
|-|-|-|
| **Modular Command System** | Hierarchical Cobra command structure    | Add new features without breaking changes; maintain clean separation of concerns |
| **Shared Core Libraries**  | Centralized logging/config/error packages | Uniform behavior across all commands; simplified maintenance            |
| **Plugin-Friendly**       | Go-native package imports               | Extend functionality by importing external libraries as dedicated modules |
| **Self-Documented Design** | Clear naming, structured help commands, and embedded usage guides | Easier maintenance, faster onboarding, and smoother evolution of the system |  



## CI/CD Ready

Luc fits seamlessly into pipelines:  



**Zero-interaction**  
- Fully automated, no user prompts or manual input required  
- Batch-process ready (scriptable, cron-friendly)  
- Pipeline-compatible (CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, etc.)  
- Idempotent where applicable (safe for repeated runs)  







Commands run non-interactively (no prompts)  
```sh
luc kbe create runall --force # No manual approval needed
```  
**Pipeline-friendly**  

Pre-built for GitHub Actions/Jenkins/GitLab:  
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
- name: Deploy cluster  
  run: luc kbe create runall --file config.yaml
```  


**Secure**  
Auth via `$ENV_VARS` only (no CLI inputs)  

## Use Cases

Create **Kubernetes Clusters**: on demand
  - production-grade k8s cluster
  - pre production-grade k8s cluster
  - any number of stagging env

Use **Infra-as-CLI**: Replace complex scripts management and version with a simple command line fully documented and versioned.
